## Understnding Metrics like - Accuracy, ROC, AUC, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, Specificty, True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate

What is Precision and Recall?

What is ROC Curve?

What is AUC?

What is the best value for ROC curve?

What is Precision-Recall Curve?

What is the best value for Precision-Recall Curve?

What is Senitivity and Specificity?

When to use ROC curve and when to use precision-recall curve?

which is the better curve for interpreting model performance when you have imbalance dataset ROC or Precision-recall and why?

What is ACcuracy?

In case of imbalance dataset , does accuracy serve to be a better metric for model evaluation, if not why?
