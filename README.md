## Undesratnding Metrics like - Accuracy, ROC, AUC, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, Specificty, True Positive Rate, False POsitive Rate

What is Precision and Recall
What is ROC Curve
What is AUC Curve
What is the best value for ROC curve
What is Precision-Recall Curve
What is the best value for Precision-Recall Curve
What is Senitivity and Specificity
When to use ROC curve and when to use precision-recall curve
which is the better metrics when you have imbalance dataset and why
What is ACcuracy
In cae of imbalance dataset , does accuracy serve to be a better metric for model evaluation, if not why?
